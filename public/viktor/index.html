                </h2>

                    <img src="/viktor/image/amir.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="340" style="float: right;"> 
                    Tashkent’s main streets radiate from Amir Timur maydoni, desecrated by ex-President
                    Karimov without warning in 2010 as part of his grand plan to ‘beautify’ the city.
                    The dozens of century-old chinar (plane) trees that provided shade for the legions
                    of chess players and strollers who once populated the park were all cut down.
                    With the chess players now gone, the statue of Timur on horseback in the middle
                    of the square cuts a lonely figure. A glance under the statue reveals that the
                    stallion has been divested of a certain reproductive appendage. Just who stole it is one of
                    Tashkent’s great mysteries. Fortunately the horse’s formidable family jewels remain intact.
                    <br>
                    Nobody is quite sure why Karimov cut down the chinar trees but conventional wisdom holds that
                    he wanted to allow unobstructed views of the new, preposterously large Dom Forum.
                    It’s usually closed but occasionally hosts state-sponsored events for honoured guests.
                    You may recognise the tigers on the facade from the Sher Dor Medressa at the Registan in Samarkand.
                    <br>
                    Further west, good-luck pelicans guard the gates to Mustaqillik maydoni (Independence square),
                    where crowds gather to watch parades on Independence Day and whenever else the government
                    wants to stir up a bit of nationalistic spirit. The shiny white edifice on the western
                    side of the square is the relatively new Senate building. East of the square across Rashidov,
                    the animal-festooned facade of the Tsarist-era Romanov Palace faces the Art Gallery of Uzbekistan,
                    and is now closed to the public.
                    <br>
                    North of Mustaqillik maydoni is the Crying Mother Monument. Fronted by an eternal flame,
                    it was constructed in 1999 to honour the 400,000 Uzbek soldiers who died in WWII.
                    The niches along its two corridors enshrine their names.
                    <br>
                    The New Soviet men and women who rebuilt Tashkent after the 1966 earthquake are
                    remembered in stone at the Earthquake Memorial. Soviet propagandists made much
                    of the battalions of these ‘fraternal peoples’ and eager urban planners who came from around
                    the Soviet Union to help with reconstruction. But when Moscow later announced it would give 20%
                    of the newly built apartments to these (mainly Russian) volunteers and invite them to stay,
                    local resentment boiled over in street brawls between Uzbeks and Russians in the so-called
                    Pakhtakor Incident of May 1969.<br>

                    It’s worth taking the metro to reach Tashkent's sites, if only to visit some of the lavishly decorated stations.
                    A must is the Kosmonavtlar station, with its unearthly images of Amir Timur’s astronomer grandson,
                    Ulugbek, and Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, among others. Remember that photography is forbidden.

                    Downtown Tashkent’s largest park will appeal to anyone with a taste for eccentricity.
                    Soviet architects had a field day here, erecting a pod of spectacularly brutal concrete monstrosities,
                    such as the Istiklol Palace, formerly the People’s Friendship Palace, which appears like a moon-landing
                    station from a 1950s film set; and the chunky Wedding Palace.
                    <br>

                    The tightly guarded building southwest of Istiklol Palace is the Oliy Majlis, the lower house of
                    parliament, which functions as a giant rubber stamp in its infrequent sessions. Nearby are a vast
                    promenade and a post-Soviet Alisher Navoi monument.
